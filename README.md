# Lab-Two

*Journal Entry*

What I have laernt this week
I am now comfortable with the basics that we have learnt about peer coding, a lot of new info about js and coding.
All of this is reflected in my repo's which you may check as you are collaborator.

How i have learnt it: through a lot of trial and error on js

I have found the quokka feature hugely helpful, instead of having to do the "node filename.js"
if the code is correct, quokka shows it in real time right next to the code on the screen, super useful.

Challenged that I faced: Understanding the lab two requirements, i am very confused about this '^'
You can see my confusion in the index.js file attatched to this repo.

I am learning a lot though, i have come far in just two weeks and am comfortable with all that we have learned thusfar.
The best way that i learn is whenever i encounter an issue or something i am not completely sure about
i just keep trying new codes, experimenting with what does and doesn't work and 90% of the time i can figure it out.
